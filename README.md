This is a basic program for your desktop assistant. Six(1) is the original program and Sample2  is a modified program.
To use power search "Spotlight", text extractor, fancy zone, first install powertoys from microsoft store.
No machine learning is used in this project and only basic python is used to create this project.
Sample2 program is only for practice who want to experience how natural language sounds like by assistant. However thre's a limit on the word translation as it uses external source to translate the sentences 
that sounded like a real person.
Please analyse the code to know all the features and how the backend works.
Enjoy...
